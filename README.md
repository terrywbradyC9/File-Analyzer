## PURPOSE
Project Page: http://georgetown-university-libraries.github.io/File-Analyzer/

The File Analyzer and Metadata Harvester is a general purpose desktop (and command line) 
tool designed to automate simple, file-based operations.  The File Analyzer assembles a toolkit of tasks a user can perform.

The tasks that have been written into the File Analyzer code base have been optimized for use by libraries, archives, 
and other cultural heritage institutions.
